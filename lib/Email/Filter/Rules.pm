our $VERSION =  1.121;

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #!/usr/bin/perl -w
  use strict;
  use Email::Filter;
  use Email::Filter::Rules;

  my $maildir = '/home/jbisbee/mail/';
  my $msg = Email::Filter->new(emergency => $maildir . 'emergency');

  my $mail_lists = Email::Filter::Rules->new(
      rules => '/home/jbisbee/bin/mail_lists'
  );

  if (my $mail_list_folder = $mail_lists->apply_rules($msg)) {
      $msg->accept($maildir . $mail_list_folder);
  }

  $msg->accept($maildir . 'inbox');

Where the 'rules' can be a filename, array ref, or scalar and looks like this

  # DESTINATION FOLDER <space> Email::Filter->$METHOD(S) <space> SUBSTRING

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Email::Filter::Rules is a simple way to route e-mail into folders without
having to touch your filter script.  I used to edit my filter script 
often to add or remove e-mail lists and often would fat finger something
and enter a typo.  This would result in all my e-mail bouncing and all in
all would be a real bummer.

I wanted to make it syntax simple so it wouldn't end up looking like to awful
procmail recipe or some cryptic piece of junk.

=head1 USAGE

Simply put, a rule consists of a destination folder, one to many Email::Filter 
method names, and a substring to test the result of the method call.

  DESTINATION FOLDER <space> Email::Filter->$METHOD(S) <space> SUBSTRING

where a rule looks like this

  lists/perl/pm/southflorida    to:cc southflorida-pm@mail.pm.org

each rule is tested and quotemeta is used on the substring

  $msg->to =~ /southflorida-pm\@mail\.pm\.org/i
  $msg->cc =~ /southflorida-pm\@mail\.pm\.org/i

and the destination folder is returned for the first matching test

  lists/perl/pm/southflorida

and now I have the mail folder, I can tell the Email::Filter object to accept 
to that folder.

So thats it, short, simple, and to the point.  No more boucing e-mails by 
editing my filter directly. :)

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 Email::Filter::Rules->new( rules => $rules )

=over 4

=item * rules

Can be a scalar, array reference, or a file name name.

=item * debug

Boolean to turn on warnings during apply_rules
